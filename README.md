💎 Diamond Price Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the price of diamonds based on their attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, and dimensions. Using machine learning regression models, the project explores data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building to achieve accurate predictions.

The notebook demonstrates the full workflow:

📥 Importing and cleaning data

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

⚙️ Feature Engineering

🤖 Model Training & Evaluation (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost, etc.)

📈 Performance comparison using RMSE and R² score

📂 Dataset

Dataset: Diamond Price Prediction.csv

Rows: 53,940

Features:

carat → Weight of the diamond

cut → Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

color → Diamond color (D–J)

clarity → Diamond clarity (I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF)

depth → Total depth percentage

table → Width of top of diamond relative to widest point

price → Price of the diamond in USD (target variable)

x, y, z → Dimensions of the diamond (length, width, depth)
